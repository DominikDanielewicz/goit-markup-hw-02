### Description

Task completed during the GoIT Fullstack Developer course. In this project I'm creating basic HTML markup, page layout, with basic CSS styling.

- Markup validated with dedicated online service - https://validator.w3.org/
- In the root of the project, there is a folder called images, which contains images.
- There are no capital letters, spaces and transliteration in the file names, only English letters and words.
- All images and text content are taken from the Figma design.
- All raster images are optimized using squoosh - https://squoosh.app/.
- Source code is formatted with Prettier.
- The code is in line with the guide - https://codeguide.co/.
